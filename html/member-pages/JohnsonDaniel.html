            <p style="margin-top: 2vh">
                I grew up in Kodiak, Alaska and started my computer science journey during the senior year of high
                school. I enrolled in an applied engineering class partnered with a program called “A World Bridge”
                which was also partnered with NASA Ames Research Center. During my year with the program I learned about
                JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Linux operating systems while working on various real-world projects.
                I was studying and working on projects after school for hours on end while my teacher, Mr. Seraphim,
                supervised me after school and enabled my learning and growth. I was enthralled by the program,
                experience, and significant growth in my skills as were the directors of the program. At the end of the
                year, they offered me a summer intern position for NASA Ames Research Center. I promptly accepted and
                started work on the NASA CitySmart WorldWise project.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 2vh">
                After interning with NASA Ames Research center, I headed off to college. At the University of Alaska
                Anchorage, I started off as a biology major, but I quickly realized my interest in Computer Science far
                outshined the former and changed my major accordingly. I have been studying Computer Science in school
                since my major change and moved to Seattle, Washington to continue my studies. I will complete an
                Associate of Science at Seattle Central College in the Spring of 2022 and move on to the University of
                Washington's Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering in the Fall.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 2vh">
                In addition to my studies, I have joined various clubs such as the Seattle Central's Programming Club
                and Rocket Club.
