        <p>Currently a student in the Web Development program at Seattle Central Community College. I am interested in both front-end and back-end web development. I've harbored a few passions that inform these interests. Lifelong hobbies like photography, design, and experimenting with different mediums in art motivate my interest in front-end development while my infatuation with logic, puzzles, mathematics, data science, systems, and statistics draw me to back-end development.</p>

        <p>Previously I spent over 15 years working various positions within the restaurant industry, mostly in the front of the house as a bartender. My love of people, food, and flavors kept me in restaurants but the pandemic combined with a preexisting urge to return to school brought me to this program.</p>
         
        <p>Beyond school and work and the aforementioned interests I also love music, foraging, growing food, studying foodways and diasporas, history, social sciences, mycology, promoting community science, and my beloved cats.</p> 
        <a id="one"></a><h3>Cards Against the Brink</h3>
        <a href="https://www.ebrink.online/cards-redux">Live on Ebrink.Online</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/brinkbrink/cards-redux">Github repo</a>
              <p>This project began as a hunt for ways to entertain across the coast from my family during the early days of COVID-19. While the hunt provided me with plenty of options, they weren't the options I wanted, so naturally I decided to craft my own! I decided on shamelessly mocking the modern day classic <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> down to the <span class="helvetica">Helvetica Nue</span>. This web application utilizes CSS3, HTML5, vanilla JavaScript and JQuery.</p>

              <p>Cafe Che Che is a local, woman-owned coffee bean roastery with a website poised to show off their products, give more information about the business and its owner, host a store for national orders as well as provide a Google form for local orders. The owner of the business and its accompanying website came to me for a website refresh. It “worked,” but it still had unfulfilled potential.</p>

              <p>A full-stack web application made to keep track of the user's tape collection or inventory. This application utilizes React, Express, and Node.js technologies.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/brinkbrink/p4-rss-feed">Github repo</a>
              <p>Worked as team lead to create customizeable RSS feed web application. Uses SQL to store manipulated XML format to scape feeds, Bootswatch for styles, and PHP to tie it all together.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/brinkbrink/vic-v1">Github repo</a>
              <p>Seattle area musician and artist was in need of a new website to showcase their work. They wanted something simple so as not to distract from their intricate illustrations and album cover art. This website includes a main page featuring illustrations, a page with embedded music, as well as contact and project pages.</p>
